## Motivation and Context

This repository contains the solutions for the exercises sheets used in the class of Statistical Methods (MEST - L.EIC020) given for the BsC in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP.  
The solutions were made mostly by me and although I tend to check them with the solutions given by the teachers, there may be some errors (please open an issue if you spot any of them).  
Besides the solutions, and probably the most interesting part is that I've created tutorials explaining general and common functions in R which I used throughout the exercises. Again, these were mostly made by me so if you spot any problems please let me know so I can correct them.

Although R is not a part of the evaluation for this class, I found that it would be an interesting challenge to learn more about this "niche" language and solve/graph the exercises using it.
If you have any other suggestions please message me so I can improve this project further :)
